# Scheduled Generation Run

This file is the complete procedure for one unattended generation run. Each run
produces exactly one EN/TR page pair, validates it, and pushes it directly to `main`.
Every push to `main` triggers the GitHub Pages deploy, so a pushed page is live within
minutes: push only pages that passed every check below. Nobody is watching the run: never ask questions, never wait
for input, make the most reasonable decision and record it in the log.

## 1. Set up the workspace

1. Clone `gorkemsari/distributed-systems`. If the repository is not available in the
   session, attach it with push access first.
2. Check out `main` and pull it so the run starts from the newest queue.

## 2. Pick the work item

1. Open `authoring/queue.md` and take the first row whose status is `todo`.
2. If there is no `todo` row, append `- <date> queue empty, nothing to do` to
   `authoring/log.md`, commit it with the message `chore(queue): queue empty [skip ci]`,
   push, and stop. `[skip ci]` prevents a deploy for a commit with no page changes.
3. Note the row's `Type` (`topic`, `chapter-overview`, `part-overview`), `Slug`, and
   `Title`. Find the row's part and chapter in the sidebar of `astro.config.mjs`.

## 3. Load the rules and the context

1. Read `authoring/project-instruction.md` in full. It is the binding specification.
2. Read both files in `authoring/examples/` (EN and TR).
3. Read the sidebar in `astro.config.mjs`: it defines every valid slug, the canonical
   owner of every topic, and the Turkish terminology (`translations.tr`).
4. Gather the context the page needs, without copying from it:
   - Topic page: list the other topics in the same chapter and the topics the page
     will likely link to. For any of them that already has status `done`, read its EN
     page so this page links to it instead of re-explaining it, and stays consistent
     with what it says. Do not read pages whose status is `todo`; they are stale.
   - Chapter Overview: read the EN pages of every topic in the chapter (all are `done`
     by construction of the queue order).
   - Part Overview: read the EN Chapter Overviews of the part.
5. The previous version of the page, if any, was written under an older specification.
   Do not use it as a source or a model. Write the page from scratch.

## 4. Verify before writing

For facts that are version-dependent, recent, or that you are not certain of
(config keys, defaults, release behavior, incident details, paper titles, years),
check them with web search before using them. If a fact cannot be confirmed, omit it
or phrase it as uncertain. Never invent numbers, incidents, config keys, or citations.
Label every illustrative number as illustrative.

## 5. Choose the depth tier, then write the pages

1. Topic pages only: before writing, outline what the page must contain to satisfy the
   depth standard (mechanism steps, correctness argument, worked example, real-system
   variants, failure modes, decision guidance). From that outline, choose the tier as
   defined in section 2.1 of the instruction: `standard` (3,000-4,500 EN prose words) or
   `deep` (4,500-7,000). Decide from the content, not from how famous the topic is.
   Overview pages have no tier.
2. Write the complete English page, then the Turkish page, exactly as the instruction
   specifies. `lastUpdated` is today's date in `yyyy-mm-dd`, unquoted.
3. If the finished English page falls outside its tier, re-decide honestly. A page that
   needs 5,000 words to reach professional depth becomes `deep`; it is never cut down to
   4,500. A page that reached 5,000 through repetition or framing is trimmed in the order
   the instruction gives, never by removing mechanism, correctness, the worked example,
   failure modes, decision guidance, or warning asides. Above 7,000, refocus on the
   page's own topic and record a split proposal in the log.
4. Paths: if a file for the slug exists at `<slug>.mdx` or `<slug>/index.mdx` under
   `src/content/docs/{en,tr}/`, overwrite that exact path. Otherwise topics go to
   `<slug>.mdx` and overviews go to `<slug>/index.mdx`.
5. Remove any `sidebar:` block from the frontmatter; navigation is defined in
   `astro.config.mjs`.

## 6. Validate and self-review

1. Run `python3 authoring/check.py <slug> --type <type> --depth <tier>` from the
   repository root (`--depth` only for topic pages).
2. Build the site: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (install pnpm with `npm i -g pnpm`
   if it is missing), then `pnpm build`. A failed build is an error, the same as a
   `check.py` error: read the build log, find the page that broke, and fix it.
   This local build does not render Mermaid; production does, at build time.
3. Render every Mermaid block of both pages with the Mermaid CLI, for example by
   writing each block to a `.mmd` file and running `mmdc -i block.mmd -o block.svg`
   (install it with `npm i -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` if `mmdc` is missing). Any
   block that fails to render is an error: in production a diagram that fails is
   published as raw code. Keep diagram syntax conservative: quote labels with
   special characters and use only syntax shown in the instruction and examples.
4. Fix every `ERROR` and re-run until it prints `PASS`. Read every `WARN` and fix it
   when it points at a real problem (for example a low TR/EN word ratio usually means
   the translation dropped content).
5. Then review the English page against the pre-delivery self-check and the depth
   standard in the instruction, and fix what falls short. For a `deep` page, also run
   the padding check from section 2.1: every section adds new information, no paragraph
   restates another, and no adjacent topic is re-explained instead of linked. If it
   fails, the page is `standard` with filler: remove the filler and re-classify. Check the Turkish page for
   natural phrasing, terminology that matches the sidebar, and nothing omitted.
6. If after three fix rounds `check.py`, the build, or a diagram render still fails, do not commit the
   pages. Discard the page changes (`git checkout -- src/`), set the queue row to
   `failed` with a one-line reason in `Note`, log it, commit the queue and log only with
   the message `chore(queue): <page title> failed [skip ci]`, push, and stop.

## 7. Record and push

1. In `authoring/queue.md`, set the row's status to `done`, set `Depth` to the chosen
   tier (`standard` or `deep`; `-` for overviews), and put `<date>, <EN words> words`
   in `Note`. Re-run
   `python3 authoring/build_queue.py astro.config.mjs authoring/queue.md` to refresh
   the progress line (it preserves statuses).
2. Append one line to `authoring/log.md`:
   `- <date> <time> <slug>: done, <tier>, EN <n> words, <diagrams> diagrams` plus any
   decision worth knowing (an omitted unverifiable fact, a scope choice).
   For a `deep` page, add `Deep because:` and one or two sentences naming which parts of
   the depth standard needed the room (for example: three-phase protocol with separate
   correctness arguments, four production implementations with different failure
   behavior). For a page above 6,000 words or one that hit 7,000, add the split proposal
   or state why the topic cannot be split.
3. Commit only the two page files, `authoring/queue.md`, and `authoring/log.md`. The
   commit subject is the page title exactly as written in the English frontmatter
   `title`, without quotes (for example `The Scaling Dilemma: Vertical vs. Horizontal
   Scaling`). The commit body is one line: `<slug> | <type> | <tier> | EN <n> words`.
4. Before pushing, confirm with `git status` that nothing else is staged or modified.
5. Push to `main`. If the push is rejected because the branch moved, pull with rebase,
   re-run `pnpm build`, and push again. Never force-push and never push to any other
   branch. The push starts the deploy; nothing else is needed.

## Boundaries

- One page pair per run. Do not continue to the next row.
- Never edit `astro.config.mjs`, the instruction, the examples, the scripts, or any
  page other than the one being generated.
- Push only to `main`. Never create branches, never open pull requests, never trigger
  workflows manually.
- Never push a page that failed `check.py` or `pnpm build`: every push to `main` is a
  production deploy.
- Finish with a two-line summary: the slug and result, and anything the owner should
  look at on the live site.
